# Graph Search

You can search for nodes and/or edges in the graph by using the package `@react-sigma/graph-search`.

You need to install it

```bash
npm install @react-sigma/graph-search
```

This package also export a CSS file that must be imported :

```tsx
import '@react-sigma/graph-search/lib/style.css';
```

Now you can use it the component [GraphSearch](/docs/api/graph-search/functions/GraphSearch) like in this example :

<CodePreview
  code={GraphSearchSource}
  title="Graph Search"
  component={() => {
    const { GraphSearchDemo } = require('../../../storybook/stories/GraphSearch');
    return <GraphSearchDemo style={{ height: '400px' }} />;
  }}
/>

## The graph index

Under the hood, this package is using [minisearch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minisearch). It build a minisearch
index and keep it in sync with the graphology instance of sigma.

If you need it, you can use this index in your own component. To do this, you need to :

- Use the [GraphSearchContextProvider](/docs/api/graph-search/functions/GraphSearchContextProvider) in the children of
  [SigmaContainer](/docs/api/core/functions/SigmaContainer)
- Use the hook [useGraphSearch](/docs/api/graph-search/functions/useGraphSearch) which return a
  [search function](/docs/api/graph-search/functions/useGraphSearch#search).

## Node & Edge display

This package also exposes components to display `Node` and `Edge` like they are displayed in the graph :

- [NodeById](/docs/api/graph-search/functions/NodeById) component
- [EdgeById](/docs/api/graph-search/functions/EdgeById) component

Those components must be used inside a [SigmaContainer](/docs/api/core/functions/SigmaContainer).
