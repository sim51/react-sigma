# Controls

The library comes with a system of controls, that helps you to control / interact with the graph, out of the box.

## List of controls

This is the list of available controls :

- Fullscreen button (on which you can defined the html container)
- Search control
- Zoom control (in, out & reset)

## ControlContainer

A _control_ component must be include into a [ControlContainer](/docs/api/core/functions/ControlsContainer) component.
This component takes a property called `position` which determinate where the controls will be displayed. Values are :
`top-right`, `top-left`, `bottom-right`, `bottom-left` ;

<CodePreview
  code={CompleteSource}
  title="Control container example"
  component={() => {
    const { Complete } = require('../../../storybook/stories/Complete');
    return <Complete style={{ height: '400px' }} />;
  }}
/>

## Custom render for controls

Controls have pre-defined style and icon, but you can define your own one, by specifying children component.

On the [FullScreenControl](/docs/api/core/functions/FullScreenControl) you must defined two children, the first one will
be the JSX element for the "enter fullscreen" and the second for the "exit fullscreen".

On the `ZoomControl` you must defined three children :

- zoom in
- zoom out
- zoom reset

On the Worker layout you must defined two children :

- stop
- start

<CodePreview
  code={CustomRenderSource}
  title="Custom render for control"
  component={() => {
    const { CustomRender } = require('../../../storybook/stories/CustomRender');
    return <CustomRender style={{ height: '400px' }} />;
  }}
/>

## Custom labels for I18N

Every component that display a label in a way accepts a property called `labels`, which is a map of key/value.

For example, you can change the labels of the zoom control like that :

```
<ZoomControl labels={{ zoomIn: "PLUS", zoomOut: "MINUS", reset: "RESET" }} />
```
