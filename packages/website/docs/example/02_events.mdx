# Events

Sigma dispatch various events that you can listen :

- mouse events
- touch events
- camera events
- graph events
- ...

With **react-sigma** you can listen to all those events with the help of the hook `useRegisterEvents`.

This hook helps you to register your listeners (and also do the remove for you).
Check the code below to see how to do it, and don't forget to open your browser console in preview mode.

<CodePreview
  code={EventsSource}
  title="Display in the console all sigma events"
  component={() => {
    const { Events } = require("../../../storybook/stories/Events");
    return <Events style={{ height: "400px" }} />;
  }}
/>
