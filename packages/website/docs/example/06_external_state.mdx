# External State

If you want to control the sigma instance outside the [SigmaContainer](/docs/api/core/functions/SigmaContainer)
component, you can use the forward reference feature on it.

The reference is the instance of `sigma` used in the component, and so with it, you can what ever you want, but MUST
know the API of sigma.

Here is an example that load a graph

<CodePreview
  code={ExternalStateSource}
  title="External state"
  component={() => {
    const { External } = require('../../../storybook/stories/External');
    return <External style={{ height: '400px' }} />;
  }}
/>
